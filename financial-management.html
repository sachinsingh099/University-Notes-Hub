            <h2>Unit 1: Financial Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Meaning and Nature:</strong> Financial Management is the process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling financial resources to achieve the financial goals of an organization. It focuses on ensuring proper utilization of funds, maintaining profitability, and securing long-term sustainability.</p>
            <p>Financial management plays a crucial role in decision-making related to capital investment, financing sources, dividend distribution, and risk management.</p>
            <p><strong>Objectives and Scope:</strong> The key objectives of financial management include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring sufficient availability of funds for operational and strategic needs.</li>
                <li>Optimizing the cost of capital to improve financial efficiency.</li>
                <li>Maximizing shareholder wealth through strategic financial planning.</li>
                <li>Maintaining liquidity to meet short-term obligations and ensuring solvency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Profit vs. Value Maximization:</strong> While profit maximization focuses on increasing short-term earnings, value maximization emphasizes long-term wealth creation by considering risk factors, sustainability, and overall financial health.</p>
            <p><strong>Role of Finance Executive:</strong> Finance executives are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strategic financial planning and analysis.</li>
                <li>Risk management and ensuring regulatory compliance.</li>
                <li>Managing investment portfolios and capital budgeting.</li>
                <li>Maintaining a balance between risk and return.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Agency Problem and Agency Cost:</strong> The agency problem arises when managers act in their own interests rather than prioritizing shareholders' interests. This results in agency costs, including monitoring expenses, managerial perks, and inefficient decision-making.</p>

        <section id="time-value-money">
            <h2>Time Value of Money</h2>
            <p>The concept of the time value of money (TVM) states that a rupee today is more valuable than the same rupee in the future due to earning potential. Money can be invested to generate returns, which makes early receipts preferable.</p>
            <p><strong>Future Value Calculation:</strong> Future value (FV) is the amount an investment grows to after earning interest over time. It is calculated using:</p>
            <p>FV = PV × (1 + r)^n, where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PV = Present Value</li>
                <li>r = Interest rate per period</li>
                <li>n = Number of periods</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Present Value Calculation:</strong> Present value (PV) is the current worth of future cash flows discounted at a given rate:</p>
            <p>PV = FV / (1 + r)^n</p>
            <p><strong>Annuity:</strong> An annuity is a series of equal periodic payments. It can be classified as an ordinary annuity (paid at the end of the period) or an annuity due (paid at the beginning of the period).</p>
            <p><strong>Compound Future Value of Annuity:</strong> The formula for compound future value is:</p>
            <p>FV = A × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r</p>
            <p><strong>Present Value of Annuity:</strong> The present value of an annuity is calculated as:</p>
            <p>PV = A × [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r</p>
            <p>These concepts are crucial for financial decision-making, including loan amortization, retirement planning, and capital investment evaluation.</p>

        <section id="extended-content">
            <h2>Additional Concepts in Financial Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Capital Budgeting:</strong> Capital budgeting is the evaluation and selection of long-term investment projects. Techniques include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Net Present Value (NPV):</strong> Measures the difference between present values of cash inflows and outflows.</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR):</strong> The discount rate at which the NPV of an investment becomes zero.</li>
                <li><strong>Payback Period:</strong> The time required for an investment to recover its initial cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Profitability Index (PI):</strong> A ratio that evaluates investment efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Cost of Capital:</strong> The cost of capital represents the required return necessary to make an investment worthwhile. It includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Debt Cost:</strong> The effective interest rate paid on borrowed funds.</li>
                <li><strong>Equity Cost:</strong> The return expected by equity investors.</li>
                <li><strong>Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):</strong> The overall required return for a firm.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Financial Leverage:</strong> Financial leverage refers to using borrowed funds to amplify returns. However, excessive leverage increases financial risk.</p>

            <h2>Cost of Capital</h2>
            <p>Cost of capital represents the required return on investment for a firm. It is crucial for making financing decisions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>1. Cost of Equity Share Capital:</strong> The expected return by equity shareholders.</p>
            <p>Formula: Ke = (D1 / P0) + g</p>

            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>2. Cost of Preference Share Capital:</strong> The return required by preference shareholders.</p>

            <p>Formula: WACC = (We * Ke) + (Wd * Kd) + (Wp * Kp)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We, Wd, Wp = Proportions of equity, debt, and preference capital</li>
                <li>Ke, Kd, Kp = Costs of each source</li>
            </ul>
