            <h2>Unit 1: Financial Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Meaning and Nature:</strong> Financial Management is the process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling financial resources to achieve the financial goals of an organization. It focuses on ensuring proper utilization of funds, maintaining profitability, and securing long-term sustainability.</p>
            <p>Financial management plays a crucial role in decision-making related to capital investment, financing sources, dividend distribution, and risk management.</p>
            <p><strong>Objectives and Scope:</strong> The key objectives of financial management include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring sufficient availability of funds for operational and strategic needs.</li>
                <li>Optimizing the cost of capital to improve financial efficiency.</li>
                <li>Maximizing shareholder wealth through strategic financial planning.</li>
                <li>Maintaining liquidity to meet short-term obligations and ensuring solvency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Profit vs. Value Maximization:</strong> While profit maximization focuses on increasing short-term earnings, value maximization emphasizes long-term wealth creation by considering risk factors, sustainability, and overall financial health.</p>
            <p><strong>Role of Finance Executive:</strong> Finance executives are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strategic financial planning and analysis.</li>
                <li>Risk management and ensuring regulatory compliance.</li>
                <li>Managing investment portfolios and capital budgeting.</li>
                <li>Maintaining a balance between risk and return.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Agency Problem and Agency Cost:</strong> The agency problem arises when managers act in their own interests rather than prioritizing shareholders' interests. This results in agency costs, including monitoring expenses, managerial perks, and inefficient decision-making.</p>

        <section id="time-value-money">
            <h2>Time Value of Money</h2>
            <p>The concept of the time value of money (TVM) states that a rupee today is more valuable than the same rupee in the future due to earning potential. Money can be invested to generate returns, which makes early receipts preferable.</p>
            <p><strong>Future Value Calculation:</strong> Future value (FV) is the amount an investment grows to after earning interest over time. It is calculated using:</p>
            <p>FV = PV × (1 + r)^n, where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PV = Present Value</li>
                <li>r = Interest rate per period</li>
                <li>n = Number of periods</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Present Value Calculation:</strong> Present value (PV) is the current worth of future cash flows discounted at a given rate:</p>
            <p>PV = FV / (1 + r)^n</p>
            <p><strong>Annuity:</strong> An annuity is a series of equal periodic payments. It can be classified as an ordinary annuity (paid at the end of the period) or an annuity due (paid at the beginning of the period).</p>
            <p><strong>Compound Future Value of Annuity:</strong> The formula for compound future value is:</p>
            <p>FV = A × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r</p>
            <p><strong>Present Value of Annuity:</strong> The present value of an annuity is calculated as:</p>
            <p>PV = A × [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r</p>
            <p>These concepts are crucial for financial decision-making, including loan amortization, retirement planning, and capital investment evaluation.</p>

        <section id="extended-content">
            <h2>Additional Concepts in Financial Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Capital Budgeting:</strong> Capital budgeting is the evaluation and selection of long-term investment projects. Techniques include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Net Present Value (NPV):</strong> Measures the difference between present values of cash inflows and outflows.</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR):</strong> The discount rate at which the NPV of an investment becomes zero.</li>
                <li><strong>Payback Period:</strong> The time required for an investment to recover its initial cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Profitability Index (PI):</strong> A ratio that evaluates investment efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Cost of Capital:</strong> The cost of capital represents the required return necessary to make an investment worthwhile. It includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Debt Cost:</strong> The effective interest rate paid on borrowed funds.</li>
                <li><strong>Equity Cost:</strong> The return expected by equity investors.</li>
                <li><strong>Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):</strong> The overall required return for a firm.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Financial Leverage:</strong> Financial leverage refers to using borrowed funds to amplify returns. However, excessive leverage increases financial risk.</p>

        <section id="sources-of-finance">
            <h2>Sources of Finance</h2>
            <p>Organizations require different financial sources for operations. These sources can be classified into:</p>
            
            <p><strong>1. Equity Financing:</strong> Funds raised by issuing shares. It includes:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Preferred Shares:</strong> Offer fixed dividends but limited voting rights.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>2. Debt Financing:</strong> Borrowing funds through loans and debentures. Includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Fixed-income securities issued by companies.</li>
                <li><strong>Debentures:</strong> Unsecured loans with periodic interest payments.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>3. Hybrid Financial Instruments:</strong> These combine equity and debt elements, including:</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section id="cost-of-capital">
            <h2>Cost of Capital</h2>
            <p>Cost of capital represents the required return on investment for a firm. It is crucial for making financing decisions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>1. Cost of Equity Share Capital:</strong> The expected return by equity shareholders.</p>
            <p>Formula: Ke = (D1 / P0) + g</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ke = Cost of equity</li>
                <li>D1 = Expected dividend</li>
                <li>P0 = Market price of share</li>
                <li>g = Growth rate</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>2. Cost of Preference Share Capital:</strong> The return required by preference shareholders.</p>
            <p>Formula: Kp = Dp / Pp</p>
            
            <p><strong>3. Cost of Debentures:</strong> The interest rate paid on borrowed funds.</p>
            <p>Formula: Kd = I (1 - Tax rate) / P</p>
            
            <p><strong>4. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):</strong></p>
            <p>Formula: WACC = (We * Ke) + (Wd * Kd) + (Wp * Kp)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We, Wd, Wp = Proportions of equity, debt, and preference capital</li>
                <li>Ke, Kd, Kp = Costs of each source</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>WACC helps companies evaluate their financing mix for long-term growth.</p>

            <h2>Capital Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Capital structure refers to the mix of debt and equity financing used by a company to fund its operations and growth. It is essential for maintaining financial stability and maximizing shareholder value.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance and Irrelevance Theories:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Net Income Approach:</strong> Suggests that an increase in debt results in a lower overall cost of capital and higher firm value. This theory assumes that the cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity, making leveraged firms more valuable.</li>
                <li><strong>Net Operating Income Approach:</strong> Argues that capital structure does not affect firm value. According to this approach, changing the debt-equity ratio does not influence the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and firms cannot maximize value through leverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Modigliani and Miller Proposition:</strong> In a perfect capital market, capital structure is irrelevant. However, when considering taxes, MM Proposition II suggests that leveraged firms benefit from tax shields on interest payments, making debt financing advantageous.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Factors Determining Capital Structure:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Profitability and Cash Flow:</strong> Companies with stable cash flows prefer higher debt levels due to tax benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Conditions:</strong> Economic conditions influence debt and equity availability and cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong> Firms in volatile industries use less debt to reduce financial risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility and Control:</strong> Debt allows owners to retain control, whereas equity dilutes ownership.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section id="optimal-capital-structure">
            <h2>Optimal Capital Structure</h2>
            <p>The optimal capital structure is the mix of debt and equity that minimizes the cost of capital while maximizing firm value. An optimal structure balances financial risk and returns to achieve the best financing decision.</p>
            <p><strong>EBIT-EPS Analysis:</strong> This technique helps determine the impact of different financing options on a company’s earnings per share (EPS) at various levels of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT). Firms analyze EBIT levels under different financing structures to determine the most beneficial option.</p>
            <p><strong>Point of Capital Indifference:</strong> This is the EBIT level where different capital structures provide the same EPS, helping firms decide between debt and equity financing.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="leverage">
            <h2>Leverage</h2>
            <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Leverage refers to the use of borrowed funds to enhance returns on investment. Higher leverage can lead to increased returns but also raises financial risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Types of Leverage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operating Leverage:</strong> Measures how revenue changes impact operating income due to fixed costs. Higher fixed costs lead to higher operating leverage, amplifying earnings fluctuations.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Leverage:</strong> Evaluates how debt impacts earnings per share. Companies with higher financial leverage have greater earnings volatility due to interest obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Combined Leverage:</strong> The combined effect of operating and financial leverage. A firm with high operating and financial leverage experiences amplified profitability changes with fluctuations in sales.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Computation of Leverage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operating Leverage Formula:</strong> DOL = % Change in EBIT / % Change in Sales. A higher DOL indicates that a small sales change results in a significant impact on EBIT.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Leverage Formula:</strong> DFL = % Change in EPS / % Change in EBIT. High DFL signifies that earnings are more sensitive to changes in operating profits.</li>
                <li><strong>Combined Leverage Formula:</strong> DCL = DOL × DFL. This provides a comprehensive risk assessment by combining operating and financial risk.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Practical Example:</strong></p>
            <p>Consider a company with the following financials:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sales Revenue = ₹10,00,000</li>
                <li>Variable Costs = ₹4,00,000</li>
                <li>Fixed Costs = ₹2,00,000</li>
                <li>EBIT = ₹4,00,000</li>
                <li>Interest Expense = ₹1,00,000</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Calculating Leverages:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Operating Leverage:</strong> DOL = 4,00,000 / (4,00,000 - 2,00,000) = 2.0</p>
            <p><strong>Financial Leverage:</strong> DFL = 4,00,000 / (4,00,000 - 1,00,000) = 1.33</p>
            <p><strong>Combined Leverage:</strong> DCL = 2.0 × 1.33 = 2.66</p>
            <p>This indicates that a 1% change in sales results in a 2.66% change in EPS, demonstrating high risk exposure.</p>

                        <li><strong>Net Present Value (NPV):</strong> Determines the present value of future cash flows, favoring projects with positive NPV.</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR):</strong> The discount rate at which NPV becomes zero, indicating project viability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Profitability Index (PI):</strong> Measures the ratio of benefits to costs, with a value greater than 1 signifying profitability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Non-discounting Techniques:</strong> These methods do not account for time value of money, including:

            <h2>Theories of Dividend</h2>
            <p><strong>Walter’s Model:</strong> Suggests that dividend policy is relevant and affects the firm’s valuation based on its return on investment and cost of capital. If a company earns a higher return on investment than its cost of capital, it should retain earnings instead of paying dividends.</p>
            <p><strong>Gordon’s Model:</strong> Proposes that investors prefer stable dividends, and a firm with a higher dividend payout has a higher market value. Investors see dividends as less risky than potential capital gains.</p>
            <p><strong>Modigliani and Miller (M&M) Approach:</strong> Argues that dividend policy is irrelevant in a perfect capital market and does not impact the company’s value. They assume no taxes, transaction costs, or market imperfections.</p>
