    <h2>Introduction to Financial Management</h2>
    
    <h3>Meaning of Financial Management</h3>
    <p>Financial Management is the process of planning, organizing, controlling, and monitoring financial resources to achieve organizational objectives. It ensures that funds are efficiently utilized to maximize profits and maintain business stability.</p>
    
    <h3>Nature of Financial Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Investment Decision:</strong> Determining where and how to invest capital for maximum returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Financing Decision:</strong> Choosing the best sources of funding (equity, debt, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Dividend Decision:</strong> Deciding the portion of profits to be distributed as dividends.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Identifying and mitigating financial risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity Management:</strong> Ensuring sufficient cash flow to meet obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Objectives of Financial Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profit Maximization:</strong> Ensuring that revenue exceeds costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Value Maximization:</strong> Enhancing shareholder value.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity Maintenance:</strong> Ensuring the company can meet short-term obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Reduction:</strong> Managing financial risks effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Resource Utilization:</strong> Allocating resources optimally.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conflict: Profit Maximization vs. Value Maximization</h3>
    <p>Profit maximization focuses on immediate earnings, whereas value maximization emphasizes long-term growth and shareholder wealth. Value maximization ensures sustainability and enhances market reputation.</p>
    
    <h2>Role of a Finance Executive</h2>
    <p>A finance executive plays a crucial role in managing an organization’s financial health:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzing financial reports to assess business performance.</li>
        <li>Making investment decisions to optimize returns.</li>
        <li>Managing company liquidity and ensuring cash flow stability.</li>
        <li>Ensuring compliance with financial regulations.</li>
        <li>Developing financial strategies for long-term business objectives.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Agency Problem and Agency Cost</h2>
    <p>The agency problem arises when company management’s interests do not align with those of shareholders. The cost incurred to resolve this issue is known as <strong>agency cost</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Time Value of Money</h2>
    <p>The time value of money (TVM) states that a sum of money today is worth more than the same sum in the future due to its earning potential.</p>
    
    <h3>Future Value Calculation</h3>
    <p class="formula">FV = PV × (1 + r)<sup>n</sup></p>
    
    <h3>Present Value Calculation</h3>
    <p class="formula">PV = FV / (1 + r)<sup>n</sup></p>
    
    <h3>Annuity</h3>
    <p>An annuity is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ordinary Annuity:</strong> Payments made at the end of each period.</li>
        <li><strong>Annuity Due:</strong> Payments made at the beginning of each period.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Future Value of Annuity</h3>
    <p class="formula">FV = P × [(1 + r)<sup>n</sup> - 1] / r</p>
    
    <h3>Present Value of Annuity</h3>
    <p class="formula">PV = P × [1 - (1 + r)<sup>-n</sup>] / r</p>
    
    <h2>Practical Applications of TVM</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Investment Planning:</strong> Evaluating potential investments.</li>
        <li><strong>Loan Calculations:</strong> Determining EMI payments.</li>

        <li><strong>Capital Budgeting:</strong> Evaluating long-term investment projects.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Financial Management plays a crucial role in business success, ensuring optimal utilization of financial resources while maintaining profitability. Understanding concepts such as profit vs. value maximization, agency costs, and the time value of money helps organizations in strategic decision-making.</p>

    </header>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Capital Structure</h2>
        <p>Capital structure refers to the mix of debt and equity financing used by a company to fund its operations and growth. A well-balanced capital structure ensures financial stability and profitability.</p>
        <p>Choosing the right capital structure affects the company's risk, return, and overall financial health. Companies must balance between too much debt (which increases financial risk) and too much equity (which dilutes ownership and may be costlier in the long run).</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Theories of Capital Structure</h2>
        <h3>1. Relevance Theories</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Net Income Approach:</b> This theory suggests that higher debt in the capital structure reduces the overall cost of capital, increasing the firm's value. Since debt is cheaper than equity, increasing leverage leads to higher valuations.</li>
            <li><b>Traditional Approach:</b> This theory states that an optimal mix of debt and equity exists where the cost of capital is minimized and the firm's value is maximized.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Irrelevance Theories</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Modigliani-Miller (MM) Hypothesis:</b> It states that, under perfect market conditions, capital structure does not affect a firm's value. This implies that whether a company finances itself with debt or equity, its overall worth remains unchanged.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Factors Determining Capital Structure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Profitability:</b> More profitable companies can afford to rely on equity rather than debt.</li>
            <li><b>Risk and Financial Stability:</b> Higher financial risk may lead to a preference for equity to avoid fixed interest obligations.</li>
            <li><b>Market Conditions:</b> If interest rates are low, companies may prefer debt financing.</li>
            <li><b>Legal Requirements:</b> Certain regulations may require companies to maintain a specific capital structure.</li>
            <li><b>Growth and Expansion Plans:</b> Companies planning aggressive growth may need more equity funding.</li>
            <li><b>Cost of Capital:</b> The mix of debt and equity should minimize the overall cost of capital.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Optimal Capital Structure</h2>
        <p>The optimal capital structure is the right combination of debt and equity that minimizes the firm's cost of capital while maximizing shareholder value. It varies by industry, company size, and economic conditions.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>EBIT-EPS Analysis</h2>
        <p>EBIT-EPS analysis helps in understanding the impact of financing choices on earnings per share (EPS). It assists in choosing between debt and equity financing.</p>
        <p><b>Formula:</b> 
        <br> EPS = (EBIT - Interest) × (1 - Tax Rate) / Number of Shares</p>
        <p>This formula helps determine how much of the company's earnings are available to shareholders under different financing structures.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Point of Capital Indifference</h2>
        <p>The point of capital indifference is where two different financing options yield the same EPS, making them equally attractive.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Leverage</h2>
        <p>Leverage refers to the use of debt to increase potential returns. It includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Business Risk:</b> The inherent risk associated with the industry and operations of the business.</li>
            <li><b>Financial Risk:</b> The risk that comes from the firm's financial leverage or use of debt.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Types of Leverages</h2>
        <h3>1. Operating Leverage</h3>
        <p>Operating leverage measures how revenue growth translates into operating income growth. High fixed costs lead to higher operating leverage.</p>
        <h3>2. Financial Leverage</h3>
        <p>Financial leverage is the use of debt to increase returns for shareholders. It can magnify profits but also increases risk.</p>
        <h3>3. Combined Leverage</h3>
        <p>Combined leverage considers both operating and financial leverage together, showing the total impact on earnings.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Extended Content for 50 Pages</h2>
        <p>To extend this document to 50 pages, we will include detailed explanations, examples, case studies, mathematical computations, and real-world applications of capital structure theories and leverage.</p>
        <h3>Mathematical Computations</h3>
        <p><b>Example:</b> Calculating WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital):
        <br> WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1 - Tc))
        <br> where E = Equity, D = Debt, V = Total Value (E + D), Re = Cost of Equity, Rd = Cost of Debt, Tc = Corporate Tax Rate.</p>
        <h3>Case Studies</h3>
        <p>We will examine real-world examples of how companies determine their capital structure and leverage, including firms like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.</p>
        <h3>Diagrams and Graphs</h3>
        <p>Visual aids will be included to explain complex financial concepts effectively.</p>

        <h2>Capital Budgeting and Risk Analysis</h2>
        <p>Capital budgeting is the process of evaluating and selecting long-term investments that align with a company’s strategic objectives. These investments include purchasing machinery, expanding operations, and developing new products. The success of capital budgeting decisions influences a firm's long-term profitability and financial health.</p>
        
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>A manufacturing company wants to invest in automated machinery. Using NPV analysis, they estimate future cash flows and compare them to initial investment costs.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Capital Investment Decisions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Expansion decisions:</b> Investments made to increase the capacity or size of an existing operation.</li>
            <li><b>Replacement decisions:</b> Replacing outdated or inefficient assets to maintain efficiency.</li>
            <li><b>New product investments:</b> Allocating funds to develop and launch new products.</li>

        <h2>Meaning and Significance of Dividend Policy</h2>
        <p>Dividend policy determines how much profit should be distributed to shareholders and how much should be retained for business growth. A sound dividend policy balances shareholder expectations and business growth.</p>
        
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>A company with high profits may distribute 40% as dividends and reinvest the rest in expansion.</p>
